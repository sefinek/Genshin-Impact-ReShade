   The Author grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable
   license to USE this software solely for personal purposes.

2. PERMITTED ACTIONS:
   - installing the software on your computer,

   - creating a backup copy for personal use.

   All rights, title, and interest in the software remain the property
   of the Author. This license does not transfer any ownership rights
   to you.

=============================================================
ANTI-TAMPERING / NO CIRCUMVENTION OF PROTECTION
=============================================================

It is prohibited to perform any actions intended to bypass, remove,
alter, deactivate, or interfere with technical protections implemented
in the Software, except where expressly allowed under mandatory law.

This includes, but is not limited to, attempts to analyze, reverse
engineer, modify code, bypass authorization, circumvent licensing,
tamper with file integrity checks, or use any other methods that
interfere with protective mechanisms of the Software.

Any violation of this provision constitutes a serious breach of the
license and may result in permanent revocation of access to the
Software, termination of the license, or legal action against the User.

The Author reserves the right to implement additional technical or
organizational measures to detect and prevent such activities.

=============================================================
SOFTWARE INTEGRITY AND SECURITY
=============================================================

The Author bears no responsibility for the operation of the Software
if it has been modified, integrated with third-party software, or run
in an environment that alters its code, structure, or configuration.

Any modifications, cracks, patches, or other forms of interference may
lead to malfunction of the Software and constitute a violation of this
license.

=============================================================
CLAUSE ON SEPARATION OF FREE AND PAID VERSIONS
=============================================================

For the purposes of this license:
- "Free Version" means the version of the Software made available free of
  charge, with a limited set of features.
- "Paid Version" means the extended version of the Software, available
  exclusively under an active Stella Mod Plus subscription.

1. The Free Version of the Software may be used solely for personal
   purposes and in accordance with the terms of this license.

2. It is prohibited to undertake any actions intended to bypass the
   technical or functional limitations, protections, or authorization
   mechanisms separating the free version from the paid version.
   This includes modifying files, tampering with code, emulating the
   licensing server, using cracks, patches, code injections, overlays,
   or any other methods enabling unauthorized access to paid features.
   Any attempt to bypass these limitations will be treated as a serious
   breach of this license and may result in immediate revocation of
   access to the Software.

3. The license for the Paid Version is assigned to a specific User and
   to a number of devices permitted under the purchased subscription
   tier, as defined by the Author. The activation limit may vary between
   tiers and may be changed in the future.

   The Paid Version license may be used only on devices belonging to the
   same household of the User, understood as a shared place of residence
   or shared use of equipment by family-related persons.

   Sharing, distributing, sublicensing, or allowing use of the license
   by third parties outside the household is prohibited.

4. Purchasing a Stella Mod Plus subscription does not constitute the
   purchase of the 3DMigoto software nor does it transfer any rights to
   that project. 3DMigoto is an independent component created by external
   authors and is covered by its own license. The Stella Mod Plus
   subscription only unlocks features integrating 3DMigoto with the
   Software and does not grant a license to 3DMigoto itself or its parts.

5. Differences in features, performance, or stability between the Free
   Version and Paid Version do not constitute a defect of the Software
   and do not form any basis for claims against the Author.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by
     those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways
     otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses
     are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and
     conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should
     also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the
     public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark
     any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed
     material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright.
     More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
     licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under
     specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not
     necessary for any reason — for example, because of any applicable exception
     or limitation to copyright — then that use is not regulated by the license.
     Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other
     rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material
     may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have
     copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special
     requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although
     not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
     where reasonable. More considerations for the public:

Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
          Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-
          sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
          Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part,
               for NonCommercial purposes only; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial
               purposes only.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does
          not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
          conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
          authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
          formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
          modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees
          not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
          technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
          including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
          making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
          Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of
               the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
               Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
               conditions of this Public License.

            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material. Every
               recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an
               offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
               Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You
               apply.

            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
               additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
               Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if
               doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any
               recipient of the Licensed Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
          construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
          use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
          endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
          designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
          this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
          personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
          waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor
          to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
          License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
          royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
          directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
          waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
          the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties,
          including when the Licensed Material is used other than for
          NonCommercial purposes.
